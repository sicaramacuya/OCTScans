# OCTMNSIT - Deep learning image classification
The goal of this project is to utilize deep learning for image classification. The program is going to recive as input an eye's image scan and predict a diagnose. The type of scans we are going to be using are the Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans.

# How go over the project
To go over the project is as simple as clicking the notebook file on this repo. There you would find the entire notebook. If you want to run it yourself it is a bit more trouble some because the notebook was run from colab and accesing the OCT data set is different. 

My best recomendation is to upload the content in this repo to google drive open it on google colab and just run it from there.
